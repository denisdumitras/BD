## Databases Laboratory Work Nr.10


### Prerequisites:
  - Microsoft SQL Server 2012
  - Oracle 11g/12c

### Objectives:
  - T-SQL and Oracle data types and build-in functions
  - SQL Server Data Types and Functions
  - Query and Subquery
  - Agregate Functions
  - While, Try-Catch, If-Else
  - Creating tables and indexes
  - Diagrams, Schemas and Synonyms
  - The administration of Views and common table expressions
  - The stored procedures and defined functions by user
  - Create and using of triggers
  
 ### Tasks: 
 
 1. Modify the 'inregistrare_noua' trigger, in case of update will show the discipline, ora, Cod_Grupa, Ziua, Blocul,Auditoriul

 Data_Evaluare field, where these are NOT NULLS. It should work only for 'CIB171'. In other case should appear an information
 message. 
 
 4. Create a trigger DDL which will interdict modification of 'Id_Disicpllina' column  in tables of database universitatae with
 showing the message. 
 
 5. Create a trigger DDL which will interdict modification schema of database over working hours.

 **Conclusion :**  

In this laboratory work I obtained skills operating with triggers and how they work for calling some actions for during 
another. I have studied several types of triggers: DML, DDL and LOGON.Also, I have studied structure of them and how treat the
problems creating them. I have used the AFTER, INSTEAD OF trigger. For showing some messaged I have used the PRINT command, but 
it in some cases did not work and I tried to use the Raierror() function with calling of it with PRINT ERROR_MESSAGE().
